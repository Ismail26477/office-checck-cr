# Build Errors Fixed

## Issue
Vercel build was failing with 19 errors - missing admin components that were being imported but didn't exist in the `/components/` folder.

## Solution Applied
1. Created all missing admin components in `/components/admin/` with proper kebab-case naming
2. Fixed import statements to use correct paths
3. Updated toast imports to use `sonner` library (installed in package.json)
4. Fixed context imports to use new naming convention

## Components Created
- `components/admin/add-employee-modal.tsx`
- `components/admin/admin-stats.tsx`
- `components/admin/attendance-table.tsx`
- `components/admin/analytics-dashboard.tsx`
- `components/admin/employee-directory.tsx`
- `components/admin/performance-metrics.tsx`
- `components/admin/task-approval-dashboard.tsx`
- `components/admin/admin-editor-sheets.tsx`
- `components/layout/app-header.tsx`

## Next Steps
1. Git push these changes to GitHub:
   \`\`\`bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix: Create missing admin components for deployment"
   git push origin main
   \`\`\`

2. Vercel will automatically rebuild and deploy
3. Check deployment status at: https://vercel.com/dashboard

## Build Status
All import errors should now be resolved. The app should build and deploy successfully!
